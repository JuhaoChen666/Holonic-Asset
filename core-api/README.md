Feature business models live directly under `internal/model/<feature>`. HTTP request and response contracts live in the independent `internal/dto` package; handlers only map DTOs to use-case contracts. Shared use-case and external-provider ports are owned by `internal/service`. `internal/module/task` contains task-queue abstractions, while the currently empty `internal/module/processor` is reserved for future image operations such as crop, resize, and compositing.

The Task module treats `Type` as an opaque string and `Payload` as opaque JSON. Business modules register their own type strings and handlers; Task never defines or switches on business task types. See `internal/module/task/README.md` for the River integration guide.
