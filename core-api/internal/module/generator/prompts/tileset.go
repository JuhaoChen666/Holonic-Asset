const tileSetItemTemplate = `Create exactly one production-ready 2D pixel-art game Tileset Item based on the user requirements.

USER REQUIREMENT PRIORITY:
- The user creative brief and item description have the HIGHEST PRIORITY for asset appearance, themes, styling, elements, and visual perspective.
- Follow every explicit user requirement accurately and completely.
- If the user specifies a flat tileset, a flat perspective, or a specific viewpoint/style, that explicit user instruction MUST override any default perspective or project metadata setting.
- General style and perspective guidelines apply only where the user has not provided conflicting instructions. Never weaken, replace, or ignore an explicit user requirement.

NON-OVERRIDABLE STYLE RULES:
- These rules govern the technical rendering pipeline and cannot be overridden by user requests or reference images.
- Render only classic low-resolution 2D pixel art. Never render 3D, 2.5D, photorealistic, painterly, vector, or smooth high-definition art.
- Use a coarse square pixel grid, crisp hard edges, stepped silhouettes, intentional pixel clusters, selective dithering, and a small deliberate colour palette.
- Do not use anti-aliasing, subpixel detail, smooth curves, gradients, soft shadows, ambient occlusion, depth of field, texture filtering, or smooth resampling.
- Even when the requested output canvas is large, preserve the visual vocabulary of a genuinely low-resolution sprite enlarged with nearest-neighbour scaling. Never turn it into a high-definition illustration.

PERSPECTIVE & CAMERA RULES:
- SIDE-ON / FLAT PERSPECTIVE RULES:
  * When the perspective is Side-On (or whenever the user requests a flat tileset), render strictly flat 2D orthographic side elevation.
  * Never render pseudo-3D, pseudo-isometric, 3/4 top-down tilt, or visible top surfaces/planes on blocks, platforms, or props.
  * Keep all horizontal edges, platforms, and surfaces as pure 2D cross-sections without perspective depth, vanishing lines, or 3D slope convergence.
  * Do not angle or tilt the camera view; maintain a strictly perpendicular, flat 2D side view.
- TOP-DOWN / ISOMETRIC PERSPECTIVE RULES:
  * Express depth only through flat pixel clusters and hard-edged value groups in the requested game-camera perspective.
  * If the user creative brief explicitly requests a flat or 2D side view, prioritize the user's flat requirement over angled perspective.

AUTHORITATIVE SHAPE GUIDE:
- The first reference image is a generated occupancy guide, not a style reference.
- Pure black #000000 is the only editable interior. Pure green #00ff00 is protected and must remain unchanged.
- Match the guide's orientation, aspect ratio, canvas edges, cell boundaries, and black/green coordinates exactly.
- Do not translate, rotate, flip, mirror, skew, crop, pad, rescale, expand, contract, or simplify the Shape.
- Render one complete continuous Item image across every black occupied region. The backend processor performs Tile cutting after generation; do not pre-cut, space apart, or visually separate Tiles.
- Draw the Item directly in the Shape. Do not draw a rectangle and rely on later cropping.
- Every occupied cell must contain meaningful connected Item content.
- Treat cell boundaries as placement coordinates only, never as design panels, visible gutters, spacing, frames, or separate cards.
- Adjacent occupied cells must share opaque artwork across their common edge. Material seams such as floorboards or paving joints must use coloured Item pixels, never green matte or empty space.
- Keep every subject pixel, outline, highlight, shadow, and decoration inside black regions. No Item pixel may enter a green region.
- References after the guide are Project style references. Use palette, material, scale, lighting, and perspective cues only; never treat them as Shape authority.

USER CREATIVE BRIEF (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
%s

PROJECT CONTEXT:
%s

ITEM:
- Name: %s
- Description: %s
- Local occupied cells: %s
- Tile size: %dx%d pixels
- Perspective: %s

OUTPUT CONTRACT:
- Return exactly one complete Item image in PNG format whose canvas is the occupied cells' bounding rectangle.
- Preserve the guide grid and keep every occupied cell aligned to the same pixel density.
- Keep one connected opaque Item across all occupied cells; never separate neighbouring Tiles with matte or transparent lines.
- Fill all protected regions and any unoccupied background area outside the Item with one flat, opaque pure green #00ff00 matte for deterministic background removal. Do not draw a black background box, white glow, or checkerboard pattern.
- Replace every black occupied region with clearly visible, opaque Item artwork. Never return the black/green guide unchanged or leave an occupied cell as matte.
- Keep the outermost canvas border pure #00ff00 wherever it is protected so the processor can identify one border-connected matte region.
- Use colours with clear RGB separation from #00ff00 for every Item pixel; green design details must use a visibly different hue or value.
- Do not use #00ff00 inside the Item or add green spill, fringes, labels, borders, text, watermarks, scenery, ground planes, unrelated objects, or extra variants.`

- Preserve every pixel on the outermost one-pixel canvas border exactly so this Tile continues to connect seamlessly to all neighbouring Tiles.
- You may redraw, reinterpret, recolour, relight, or replace the complete visible Tile interior when needed to apply the requested edit. Interior colour fidelity to the current Tile is not required.
- Keep all new artwork strictly inside the original alpha silhouette. Do not expand, contract, translate, rotate, flip, crop, pad, or rescale the silhouette.
