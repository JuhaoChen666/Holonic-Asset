CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT — NOT A SPRITESHEET:
- every frame contains exactly ONE complete subject and its attached or held props
- normal full-frame video, never a contact sheet, collage, grid, storyboard, or spritesheet
- never show multiple directions, multiple poses, copies, cells, borders, labels, or the reference layout

USER SPECIFICATION — AUTHORITATIVE:
- subject: %s
- style: %s
- requested action: %s
- the system will extract %d ordered frames later; do not render those frames as a sheet

REFERENCE IMAGE:
- the input is exactly ONE isolated canonical subject view from the high-resolution prototype or direction sheet
- use that subject for identity, scale, and orientation; never turn, mirror, switch views, or invent another direction
- preserve identity, proportions, details, materials, palette, and art style

ACTION:
- interpret the requested action by its actual meaning; do not map it to a generic motion preset
- show one complete cycle from the initial pose back to the same pose
- include preparation, every semantically required intermediate stage, the main extreme, complete follow-through and recovery
- strict temporal order: begin from the supplied initial pose, perform preparation before the main action, follow through before recovery, and end only after returning to that same pose
- do not start in the middle, reverse the action, jump between phases, repeat the main action before recovery, omit late stages, or freeze at the main pose

CONTINUITY:
- preserve silhouette, proportions, details, materials, equipment, and attached-part geometry
- fixed root and camera: no sliding, turning, warping, squash, stretch, scale pulsing, or detached parts

FRAMING AND BACKGROUND:
- fixed camera: no pan, tilt, zoom, shake, crop, reframe, or cut
- keep the whole subject and props inside the inner 70%%; maintain at least 15%% uninterrupted empty space on every side
- keep long parts, weapons, or tool tips inside the central area; reduce amplitude rather than reaching toward an edge
- background is perfectly uniform pure chroma green #00FF00: no floor, shadow, gradient, scenery, lighting change, particles, text, audio, trails, or motion graphics`,
