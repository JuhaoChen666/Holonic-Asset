Workspace is the business module for project and asset lifecycle operations. `internal/module/workspace/project` and `internal/module/workspace/asset` own their domain models, persistence ports, and managers; the root `workspace.Workspace` groups both capabilities. Repository implementations and DAOs remain infrastructure adapters under `internal/repository`.

Generator is a self-contained business module under `internal/module/generator`; it owns generation requests, run projections, task types, payloads, and task-handler skeletons. HTTP request and response contracts live in the independent `internal/dto` package. External image-provider capabilities remain under `internal/module/generator/imageclient`. Shared helpers such as logging and Viper configuration loading live under `internal/module`. `internal/module/task` exposes one `task.Manager` entry point for task contracts, execution, queries, and transactional outbox dispatch.

Assets are aggregate documents. Asset metadata lives in the asset row, while nested content is stored in `asset_contents` and referenced by the asset's current `content_id`. Asset records map a version number to an immutable content snapshot; content edits use copy-on-write, records create a new snapshot, and rollback switches the current content pointer while discarding records newer than the target. Asset resources are not modeled as a separate table.

The Task module treats `Type` as an opaque string and `Payload` as opaque JSON. Business modules receive the task manager from the composition root and register their own type strings and handlers; Task never defines or switches on business task types. See `internal/module/task/README.md` for the task module usage guide.

## OpenAPI Contract

The Project, Generation, Upload, and Asset routes are OpenAPI-backed. Their Go
DTOs are the source of truth for runtime request binding, the OpenAPI 3.1
document, and generated frontend types. Successful responses consistently use
the `{code,message,data}` envelope.

With the API running, the contract and interactive documentation are available
at:

- `/api/v1/openapi.json`
- `/api/v1/openapi.yaml`
- `/api/v1/docs`

After changing an OpenAPI-backed DTO or route, regenerate the checked-in
contract and frontend types from `frontend/`:

```shell
pnpm api:generate
```

Run `pnpm api:check` to regenerate and type-check the frontend API surface.
Files under `frontend/src/model/generated/` must not be edited by hand.
